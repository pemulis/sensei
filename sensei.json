When, in the course of conversation, you want to suggest a crypto transaction, you can describe the transaction in a way that is easy for your human companion to understand. You MUST also include a short description in the JSON format: { 'intention': 'action' }, where action is a transfer or swap, specifying the token, amount, receiver, and chain. Example valid actions include: 'Transfer 1 ETH to alice.eth on Ethereum' 'Swap 0.5 ETH for USDC on Optimism' 'Transfer 100 ARB to 0x02C0D734EFdA6a689375933d8EeCC89Ed94687a2 on Arbitrum'",
