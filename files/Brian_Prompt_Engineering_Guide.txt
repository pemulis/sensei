Welcome to the Brian Prompt Engineering Guide! 

This comprehensive guide aims to assist users with the necessary knowledge to craft prompts effectively for Brian. By understanding the principles outlined here, you will learn to formulate prompts that align with Brian's capabilities, ensuring optimal functionality and successful outcomes.

Getting Started
Before we dive into the examples, it‚Äôs important to understand that what makes an effective prompt in Brian is the clarity of the transaction parameters the user wants to build.

Brian‚Äôs AI capabilities consist of extracting all the attributes from the prompt, effectively extracting the user's intention and building the desired transaction flow. 

Actions Overview
We currently support the following actions:

Swap

Bridge 

Crosschain swap 

Transfer 

Approve 

Total Supply 

Balance

WrapETH

Each action has a set of attributes that Brian extracts to build the transaction. In your prompt, you must insert all mandatory attributes to make a successful prompt. 

üí∏Swap
A swap is a transaction in which the user exchanges one ERC-20 token for another. 

Attributes
action

chain

token1

token2

address

amount

Brian Prompt Engineering Tip: In Brian, you can swap 2 tokens and define the address of the receiver different from the one executing it. Moreover, you can define the amount both in the native value of the token you want to swap and in dollars. In the second case, Brian will make the transaction with the right amount converted from dollars to the token1 value using external API for getting price quotes at run time.

Example prompt: 
swap 0.01 weth for dai

swap 0.01 eth for dai with vitalik.eth as receiver

swap 20 dollars of uni for dai

üåâBridge
A bridge connects different blockchain networks, allowing transactions between them. 

Attributes
action

chain

token1

address

amount

dest_chain

Brian Prompt Engineering Tip: In Brian, you can bridge and define the address of the receiver different from the one executing it. Moreover, you can define the amount both in the native value of the token you want to swap and in dollars. In the second case, Brian will make the transaction with the right amount converted from dollars to the token1 value

Example prompt: 
Bridge 0.05 eth to arbitrum

Bridge 0.03 weth to polygon with vitalik.eth as receiver

Bridge 10 dollars of eth to zksync

‚õìÔ∏èCrosschain Swap
A crosschain swap is a type of transaction that allows for the exchange of digital assets or tokens between two different blockchain networks. In a crosschain swap, the assets are transferred from one blockchain to another, enabling users to trade or swap tokens across different chains.

Attributes
action

chain

token1

token2

address

amount

dest_chain

Brian Prompt Engineering Tip: In Brian you can make a crosschain swap and define the address of the receiver different from the one executing it. Moreover, you can define the amount both in the native value of the token you want to swap and in dollars. In the second case Brian will make the transaction with the right amount converted from dollars to the token1 value

Example prompt: 
Make a crosschain swap of 0.02 eth to dai to optimism

Make a crosschain swap of 10 usdc to dai to arbitrum with 0x... as receiver

Make a crosschain swap of 20 dollars of eth to dai to base

‚û°Ô∏èTransfer
Movement of digital assets from one account to another within the blockchain network.

Attributes
action

chain

token1

address

amount

Brian Prompt Engineering Tip: You can define the amount both in the native value of the token you want to swap and in dollars. In the second case Brian will make the transaction with the right amount converted from dollars to the token1 value

Example prompt: 
Transfer 1 usdc to vitalik.eth

Transfer 10 dollars of eth to vitalik.eth

üí£Multiple operations
Perform multiple operations in the same prompt! After the user writes the prompt, Brian will build two or more transactions that the user has to confirm.

Example prompt: 
build a portfolio of 0.5 eth and split into 5 tokens: 15% of usdc, 25% of usdt, 50% of dai, 5% of uni, 5% of link on ethereum

swap 0.1 eth for dai and swap 0.1 eth for usdc

transfer 1 eth to each: vitalik.eth, limone.eth, matteoikari.eth

Brian Prompt Engineering Tip: in a multiple-operations prompt, currently, you have to specify all the parameters, e.g., "Bridge 1 eth from Polygon to Ethereum and swap 0.5 eth to usdc".

üëåApprove
A function that allows one address to use the funds of another address within a specific contract. When you approve a contract to spend a specific amount of your tokens or assets, you are essentially permitting for that contract to transfer those assets on your behalf.

Attributes
action

chain

token1

address

amount

Brian Prompt Engineering Tip: You can define the amount both in the native value of the token you want to swap and in dollars. In the second case Brian will make the transaction with the right amount converted from dollars to the token1 value

Example prompt: 
I want to approve 7.3 dai for spending to 0x9c5142ca89eac453c1eb9ef8d5e854ca01743f6e on polygon

‚öñÔ∏èBalance
Refers to the amount of tokens a specific address has

Attributes
action

chain

token1

address

Brian Prompt Engineering Tip: you can either specify the address or refer to your address as ‚Äúmy‚Äù

Example prompt: 
what is my balance of usdc?

What is the balance of 0x75a08f634704c0060180c3a8e00f2b5991f2e5c9 in weth on gnosis?

üè¶Total Supply
Refers to the overall amount of a specific asset that is available in circulation at any given time.

Attributes
action

chain

token1

Example prompt: 

I would like to know the total supply of euroe on GNOSIS.

üí†Wrap/Unwrap native token
Wrapping ETH refers to the process of converting native ETH to wETH and viceversa

Attributes
action

chain

token1

token2

address

amount

Brian Prompt Engineering Tip: In Brian you can wrap eth and define the address of the receiver different from the one executing it. Moreover you can define the amount both in the native value of the token you want to swap and in dollars. In the second case Brian will make the transaction with the right amount converted from dollars to the token1 value

Example prompt: 
wrap 0.1 eth to weth

wrap 10 dollars of matic on polygon
